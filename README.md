roguelikeboard.jsx

roguelikeboard.jsx is a simple react.js component for rendering ASCII inspired roguelike boards on the web

In contrast with using WebGL or Canvas, I thought it would be interesting to build this renderer using the DOM. This way all fonts, colors, symbols can be set using CSS. Even the characters themselves are set using the `after:` selector.
